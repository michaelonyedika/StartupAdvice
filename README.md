# StartupAdvice

I created a Startup Advice platform using React and Typescript, which connects mentors, investors, and industry experts with startup founders and enthusiasts, offering valuable insights on launching and managing successful businesses. Users can rate these insights based on their understanding. This platform was developed using React and TypeScript, incorporating features such as user authentication, an advice feed, a 5-star rating system, and a rating overview. The advice content is stored on Firebase, and the platform is hosted on Google Firebase.
